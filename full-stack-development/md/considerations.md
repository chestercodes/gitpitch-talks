### Considerations

- C# is 'good enough'
- Popularity problems
  - Hiring 
  - Dev tools
  - Libraries

---

### Considerations

- Rethink of architecture
  - DI containers not really used
  - Fewer layers
  - Functional paradigm different
  - Different data access paradigm
- Compiler Driven Development
  - Learning curve
  - Expression over statement

---

### Potential use cases

- Easy immutable classes
- Project.Domain logic
  - Correctness
  - Legibility
  - Testing
- Scripting / REPL
- Everything else
