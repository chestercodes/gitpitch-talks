### What is F#?

@quote[F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language...](fsharp.org)

@quote[cross-platform -> F# runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows, GPUs, and browsers...](fsharp.org)

@quote[F# is to C#, what scala is to Java](someone, probably)

### F# and C# - a history

Created at Microsoft Research by Don Syme et al.

MR and F# have implemented or inspired C# features such as [Generics](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dsyme/2011/03/15/netc-generics-history-some-photos-from-feb-1999/), LINQ, Async

### Why use F#? #

@quote[The F# code is consistently shorter, easier to read, easier to refactor and contains far fewer bugs...](fsharp.org/testimonials/)

### F# 101

- ML family of languages, similar to OCaml
- Powerful static type system
- Immutable by default
- Functions!!!
- Expression based (rather than statement)
- Basic syntax:

---?code=full-stack-development/code/syntax.fsx&lang=fs

@[1-4](Assign values, infers types.)
@[6-8](Immutable by default)
@[9-14](Collections)
@[15-27](Function declaration)
@[29-37](Nested and anonymous functions)
@[39-41](Tuples)
@[43-48](String interpolation, printing to console)

### F# 101 - modules and unions

- modules - containers for code, like `namespace`
- disciminated unions - define relationships, "enums with data"

```fsharp
type Contact =
    | Email of string
    | Phone of string                      

let chestersPhone = Phone "07123 456789"                             
let chestersEmail = Email "chester@example.com"

let printContact contact =
    match contact with
    | Email email -> printfn "Email is %s" email
    | Phone phone -> printfn "Phone is %s" phone
```

---

### F# 101 - records

- immutable data structures
- easily defined
- easily copied

```fsharp

type Person = { Age: int; Name: string }

let chester = { Age = 29; Name = "Chester" }

let chesterNextYear = { chester with Age = 30 }
                                                                              //
```

---

### F# record from C# #

```csharp
public sealed class Person : IEquatable<Person>, IStructuralEquatable,
    IComparable<Person>, IComparable, IStructuralComparable
{
  public Person(int age, string name);

  public int Age { get; }
  public string Name { get; }
  
  public sealed override int CompareTo(Person obj);
  public sealed override bool Equals(object obj);
  public sealed override int GetHashCode();
  ...
  public override string ToString();
}
```

### F# 101 - Type signatures

functional programmers converse in type signatures.

---?code=full-stack-development/code/typesig.fsx&lang=fs

@[1-2](Tuple type signature)
@[4-6](simple function signature)
@[8-11](simple function signature)
@[5-6,13-14](with C# equivalent)
@[8-11,16-17](with C# equivalent)
