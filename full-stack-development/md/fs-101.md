### F# 101

- ML family of languages, similar to OCaml
- Powerful static type system
- Immutable by default
- Functions!!!
- Expression based (rather than statement)
- Basic syntax:

---?code=full-stack-development/code/syntax.fsx&lang=fs

@[1-4](Assign values, infers types.)
@[6-8](Immutable by default)
@[9-14](Collections)
@[15-27](Function declaration)
@[29-32](pipe and anonymous functions)
@[34-36](Tuples)

### F# 101 - Type signatures

functional programmers converse in type signatures.

---?code=full-stack-development/code/typesig.fsx&lang=fs

@[1-2](Tuple type signature)
@[4-6](simple function signature)
@[8-11](simple function signature)
@[5-6,13-14](with C# equivalent)
@[8-11,16-17](with C# equivalent)

### F# 101 - features

- modules - containers for code, like `namespace`
- discriminated unions - define relationships, "enums with data"
- records - immutable data structures, easily defined, created, copied
- pattern matching - similar to C#, much more powerful
