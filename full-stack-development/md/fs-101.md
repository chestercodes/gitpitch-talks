### What is F#? #

@quote[F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code.](fsharp.org)

@quote[Open source, cross-platform]

@quote[F# runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows, GPUs, and browsers. It is free to use and is open source under an OSI-approved license.](fsharp.org)

### F# and C# - a history #

@quote[F# is to C#, what scala is to Java]

Created at Microsoft Research by Don Syme et al.

MR and F# have implemented or inspired C# features such as [Generics](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dsyme/2011/03/15/netc-generics-history-some-photos-from-feb-1999/), LINQ, Async

### Why use F#? #

@quote[The F# code is consistently shorter, easier to read, easier to refactor and contains far fewer bugs. As our data analysis tools have developed … we’ve become more productive.](fsharp.org/testimonials/)

@quote[F# is excellent at concisely expressing business and domain logic. Developers trying to achieve explicit business logic within an application may opt to express their domain in F# with the majority of plumbing code in C#.](thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/f)

### F# 101

- ML family of languages, similar to OCaml
- Powerful type system to model data
- Immutable by default, functions are a big deal
- Expression rather than statement based

Basic syntax:

---?code=full-stack-development/code/syntax.fsx&lang=fs

@[1-4](Assign values, infers types.)
@[6-9](Lists)
@[11-21](Function declaration)
@[23-32](Nested and anonymous functions)
@[34-36](Tuples)
@[38-40](Printing to console)
@[42-45](Immutable by default)


### F# 102 - modules, records and unions

- modules - containers for code, work with `namespace`

- Records - immutable data structures

- disciminated unions - define relationships between data, "enums with data"

### F# 103 - Type signatures

functional programmers converse in type signatures.

```fsharp
// int
let anInt = 30

// int -> string
let printAge intArg =
    "Person is " + (intArg.ToString())

// (string -> string) -> string -> string
let addALittleSomething funArg stringArg =
    (funArg stringArg) + " something"
```

---

```fsharp
// int -> string
let printAge intArg =
    "Person is " + (intArg.ToString())
// Func< int, string >

// (string -> string) -> string -> string
let addALittleSomething funArg stringArg =
    (funArg stringArg) + " something"
// Func< Func<int, string>, string, string>
```
