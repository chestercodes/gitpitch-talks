### What is F#? #

@quote[F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language. It empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable and robust code.](fsharp.org)

@quote[Open source, cross-platform]

@quote[F# runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows, GPUs, and browsers. It is free to use and is open source under an OSI-approved license.](fsharp.org)

### F# and C# - a history #

@quote[F# is to C#, what scala is to Java]

Created at Microsoft Research by Don Syme et al.

MR and F# have implemented or inspired C# features such as [Generics](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dsyme/2011/03/15/netc-generics-history-some-photos-from-feb-1999/), LINQ, Async

### F# and C# - soon #

### Why use F#? #

@quote[The F# code is consistently shorter, easier to read, easier to refactor and contains far fewer bugs. As our data analysis tools have developed … we’ve become more productive.](fsharp.org/testimonials/)

@quote[F# is excellent at concisely expressing business and domain logic. Developers trying to achieve explicit business logic within an application may opt to express their domain in F# with the majority of plumbing code in C#.](thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/f)

### F# 101

- ML family of languages, similar to OCaml
- Powerful type system to model data
- Immutable by default, functions are a big deal
- Expression rather than statement based

Basic syntax:

---?code=full-stack-development/code/syntax.fsx&lang=fs

@[1-4](Assign values, infers types.)
@[6-9](Lists)
@[11-21](Function declaration)
@[23-32](Nested and anonymous functions)
@[34-36](Tuples)
@[38-40](Printing to console)
@[42-45](Immutable by default)

### F# 101 - modules and unions

- modules - containers for code, like `namespace`
- disciminated unions - define relationships - "enums with data"

```fsharp
type Contact =
    | Email of string
    | Phone of string                      

let chestersPhone = Phone "07123 456789"                             
let chestersEmail = Email "chester@example.com"

let printContact contact =
    match contact with
    | Email email -> printfn "Email is %s" email
    | Phone phone -> printfn "Phone is %s" phone
```

---

### F# 101 - records

- immutable data structures
- easily defined
- easily copied

```fsharp

type Person = { Age: int; Name: string }

let chester = { Age = 29; Name = "Chester" }

let chesterNextYear = { chester with Age = 30 }
                                                                              //
```

---

### F# record from C# #

```csharp
public sealed class Person : IEquatable<Person>, IStructuralEquatable,
    IComparable<Person>, IComparable, IStructuralComparable
{
  public Person(int age, string name);

  public int Age { get; }
  public string Name { get; }
  
  public sealed override int CompareTo(Person obj);
  public sealed override bool Equals(object obj);
  public sealed override int GetHashCode();
  ...
  public override string ToString();
}
```

---

### F# 101 - Type signatures

functional programmers converse in type signatures.

```fsharp
// string * int
let nameAndAgeTuple = "Chester", 29

// int -> string
let printAge intArg =
    "Person is " + (intArg.ToString())

// (string -> unit) -> string -> string
let addALittleSomething action stringArg =
    action stringArg
    stringArg + " something"
```

---

scary, but same as C#

```fsharp

// C#   Func< int,   string >
// F#         int -> string
let printAge intArg =
    "Person is " + (intArg.ToString())

// C#   Func< Action<string>,     string,  string >
// F#         (string -> unit) -> string -> string
let addALittleSomething action stringArg =
    action stringArg
    stringArg + " something"
                                                                                                              //
```
